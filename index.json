The model consists of multiple coupled partial differential reaction--diffusion equations governing the evolution of susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and deceased fractions of the total population in a given region. We consider the problem of model calibration, validation, and prediction following a Bayesian learning approach implemented in OPAL (the Occam Plausibility Algorithm). Our goal is to incorporate COVID-19 data to calibrate the model in real-time and make meaningful predictions and specify the confidence level in the prediction by quantifying the uncertainty in key quantities of interests. Our results show smaller mortality rates in Texas than what is reported in the literature. We predict 7003 deceased cases by September 1, 2020 in Texas with $$95$backslash$%$$CI 6802--7204. The model is validated for the total deceased cases, however, is found to be invalid for the total infected cases. We discuss possible improvements of the model.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian-based predictions of COVID-19 evolution in Texas using multispecies mixture-theoretic continuum models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656096000,"objectID":"06df22a302d0cfb6a0a7d84c4a9a05fd","permalink":"http://www.lianghaocao.com/talk/a-globally-convergent-modified-newton-method-for-direct-minimization-of-ohta--kawasaki-energy/","publishdate":"2022-06-24T13:40:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/a-globally-convergent-modified-newton-method-for-direct-minimization-of-ohta--kawasaki-energy/","section":"event","summary":"20 mins conference talk at USNC/TAM 2022 on a modified Newton solver for the Ohta--Kawasaki model","tags":[],"title":"A globally convergent modified Newton method for direct minimization of Ohta--Kawasaki energy","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654183200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654183200,"objectID":"297b852a6b80f7633f0262db228ad710","permalink":"http://www.lianghaocao.com/talk/bayesian-model-calibration-for-diblock-copolymer-self-assembly-using-power-spectrum-of-microscopy-image-data/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T10:20:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/bayesian-model-calibration-for-diblock-copolymer-self-assembly-using-power-spectrum-of-microscopy-image-data/","section":"event","summary":"20 mins conference talk at EMI22 on uncertainty quantification for material self-assembly models","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian model calibration for diblock copolymer self-assembly using power spectrum of microscopy image data","type":"event"},{"authors":["Lianghao Cao","Omar Ghattas","J.

The scheme employs a globally convergent modified Newton method with line search which is shown to be mass-conservative, energy-descending, asymptotically quadratically convergent, and typically three orders of magnitude more efficient than the commonly used gradient flow approach. The regularity and the first-order condition of minimizers are carefully analyzed. A numerical study of the chemical substrate guided directed self-assembly of diblock copolymer melts, based on a novel polymer-substrate interaction model and the proposed scheme, is provided.
